This a basic demonstration of a 'task' senario

To complete this 'task' you just need to create a pod
with name starting 'basictest' e.g. basictest-xxxx

Creating a deployment is OK for this

Note:
- tasks: explain a task to perform and check the result
- fixes: create a problem config and check the result
- quizzes: to be done ...
